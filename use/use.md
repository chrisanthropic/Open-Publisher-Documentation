We offer a few options for working with Open-Publisher so that you can choose whichever method you are most comfortable with.

- You can use our [Bash](bash.html) Scripts.
- You can use our [Rakefile](rake.html).
- You can use [Docker](docker.html).

All of the results are identical but I understand that different people prefer different tools so I do my best to provide options.
