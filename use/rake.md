## Create our Example Book
First create the contents of our Example book:
  - `bundle exec rake skel`
  
Now create the actual books:
  - `bundle exec rake all[Example]`
  
Open the "Books" directory to see the results.

## Start a New Book
Use Rake to create a new book. It creates everything needed and puts it in the right places so that you can just write.

Run the command `bundle exec rake build` and enter the title of your book when prompted.

## Write Your Manuscript
Paste your manuscript in `Source/_includes/$BOOK-TITLE/chapters.md`

## Update Your MetaData
The beginning of your `Source/_includes/$BOOK-TITLE/chapters.md` contains "YAML Front Matter" and is used to define metadata about your book that we use in various places for various templates. Anything with an asterisk is optional.

## Customize Common Pages
Open-Publisher uses three 'common' pages by default which are shared between all books. These pages will need to be customized with your information.

Customize the contents of `Source/_includes/amazon_review.md`, `Source/_includes/bio.md`, and `Source/_includes/license.md`.

* **Amazon Review**: This page is used for our Amazon template and is added to the last page of the book immediately following the ending. We use it to kindly request that the reader consider leaving a review and provide a link to the Amazon page where they can easily do so.

* **Bio**: This page is used as a bio page for more information about the author.

* **License**: This is the license page. We default to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license because that's what we personally use. Feel free to modify it to your preferred license.
  * NOTE: Due to technological limitations the license page here IS NOT used when creating a print-ready PDF which uses it's own license page as defined in the LaTeX template at `Pandoc/templates/cs-5x8-pdf.latex` in the "Create a copyright page" block.
